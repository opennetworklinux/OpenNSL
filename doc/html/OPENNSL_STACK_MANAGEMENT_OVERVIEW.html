<div class="textblock"><p>Network switches can act in a stand alone manner or be part of a larger distributed switching system. Such systems may be simply a small number of switching devices within a single box or a larger number of switching devices across multiple stacked boxes or in a chassis.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, each switch device must be programmed with its address in the larger system (called a module identifier or module ID) and have some means of directing traffic to other devices in the system. This topology information may be statically defined or dynamically determined by using stacking software.</p>
<p>These defined API routines are the building blocks to set the system wide addressing and topology information.</p>
<p>Some fabric switches provide a mechanism called module mapping that allows up to 128 module identifiers to be used in a system.</p>
<p>There are two general types of stack ports that are supported. </p>
<ul>
<li>HiGig ports are dedicated 10 gigabit/second stack ports. These ports are found on most switch devices. There are dedicated fabric switches that consist only of HiGig ports as well as network switches that contain one or more front-panel ports (which can be Fast Ethernet (FE), Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) or Ten Gigabit Ethernet (XE) ports) and one or more HiGig ports. </li>
<li>Some devices may have gigabit ports that are capable of being put into a stack mode where each packet sent or received with an extra stack tag that provides stack wide addressing information. This type of stack port is called an SL stack port or front-panel stack port.</li>
</ul>
<p>SL stack ports can be run in either simplex or duplex mode. Simplex stack ports transmit to one remote device and receives from another. Full connectivity in the stack requires that all stack ports in the system form a non-redundant ring. Simplex stack rings require that the count of systems in the ring be programmed into each stack port. A ring of systems can be constructed with only a single stack port on each system, but a single link failure can disrupt the entire ring.</p>
<p>An SL stack port in duplex mode transmits and receives with a single remote system. to build a ring of stacked systems, two stack ports are required, but the ring is redundant. A single failed stack link need not disrupt the entire ring of stacked switch devices. </p>
