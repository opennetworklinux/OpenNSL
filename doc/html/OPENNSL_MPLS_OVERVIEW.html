<div class="textblock"><p>MPLS support can be broken down into two categories, Layer-2 and Layer-3 MPLS.</p>
<p>L2 MPLS consists of point-to-point Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) and point-to-multipoint Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Ethernet transport services.</p>
<p>In VPWS, Ethernet frames are mapped into a MPLS pseudowire based on incoming port plus packet header information. At the end of a pseudowire, forwarding of Ethernet frames after MPLS decapsulation is based on the MPLS label lookup.</p>
<p>In VPLS, Ethernet frames of interest are also identified by incoming port plus packet header information. Ethernet frames are switched into one or more MPLS pseudowires based on the MAC DA lookup. At the end of a pseudowire, frames again are switched based on MAC DA lookup.</p>
<p>L3 MPLS deals with the establishment of MPLS tunnels. At the MPLS tunnel initiation point, packets entering the tunnel are encapsulated with an MPLS header (label PUSH operation). IPv4 and IPv6 packets can be directed into an MPLS tunnel based on the DIP lookup. Along the path of the MPLS tunnel, MPLS label SWAP, PUSH, PHP, and POP operations are supported. At the end of an MPLS tunnel, forwarding of IPv4 and IPv6 packets is based on DIP lookup. Virtual routing tables are supported for the DIP lookup.</p>
<p>In the MPLS APIs, the concept of VPN is introduced. A VPN can be of type VPLS, VPWS, or L3:</p>
<p>For VPLS, a VPN is similar to a VLAN, which identifies a group of physical ports to be included in a broadcast domain. However, instead of physical ports, a VPLS VPN identifies a group of "virtual-ports" to be included in a broadcast domain. In the MPLS APIs, a "virtual-port" is called an MPLS port (see description below). The VPN ID is used to qualify MAC DA lookups in VPLS.</p>
<p>For VPWS, a VPN consists of two MPLS ports. Packets arriving on one MPLS port are sent directly out the other MPLS port.</p>
<p>L3 VPNs are used to identify a virtual routing table. When creating an L3 VPN, a VRF must be specified. At the end of a MPLS tunnel, the IPv4 or IPv6 DIP lookup is qualified by VRF associated with the L3 VPN. </p>
