       How to Install OpenNSL Binary
       ----------------------------

This document describes how to install OpenNSL binary provided
in this package on the supported Wedge Network Switch platform. Refer the Release Notes
for a list of platforms.

Building OpenNSL
================
Source code for OpenNSL sample applications may be built on the switch. Use the
following steps to compile OpenNSL including sample applications.

1) Extract the code tarball into the destination directory say opennsl_root.

2) Go to output directory. For Wedge Network Switch platform, it is
   opennsl_root/opennsl/output/wedge-trident

3) Set KERNEL_SRC to point to the kernel headers.
   Wedge Network Switch platform is supported with CentOS 6.5 Linux distribution. 

   Eg: export KERNEL_SRC==/usr/src/kernels/2.6.32-431.el6.x86_64 or 2.6.32-504.8.1.el6.x86_64

4) Issue "make" to create an OpenNSL shared library object, linux kernel modules.

Note: OpenNSL requires MAKE version 3.82. MAKE version 4.0 is not supported.
To force the MAKE version, set the following variable.
"export MAKEVER=3.82"

5) The deliverables folder : opennsl_root/opennsl/output/wedge-trident/build
   shall have the following files.
   a) Linux kernel module                     : linux-kernel-bde.ko
   b) Linux user module                       : linux-user-bde.ko
   c) KNET driver module                      : linux-bcm-knet.ko
   d) OpenNSL shared object library           : libopennsl.so

Building example Applications
=============================
NOTE: This section is applicable only if the package includes example applications.

Source code for OpenNSL sample applications may be built on the switch. The
example applications are dynamically linked with the OpenNSL shared library.
Use the following steps to compile example applications.

1) Go to output directory. For Wedge Network Switch platform, it is
   opennsl_root/opennsl/output/wedge-trident.

2) Issue "make examples" to compile all the sample applications


Downloading and running OpenNSL sample applications
===================================================

1) cd to target deliverables directory. For Wedge Network Switch platform, it is
   opennsl_root/opennsl/output/wedge-trident/build.

2) Use the following commands to update the linux kernel modules
   i  ) Execute "lsmod" to list the installed linux kernel modules.
   ii ) Remove the linux kernel and user modules by using "rmmod" command.
   iii) Install linux kernel modules built for OpenNSL platform by using
        the following commands. Please ensure that the modules are removed 
        before inserting it using 'rmmod' command.
        # mknod /dev/linux-kernel-bde c 127 0
        # mknod /dev/linux-user-bde c 126 0
        # mknod /dev/linux-bcm-knet c 122 0
        # insmod linux-kernel-bde.ko
        # insmod linux-user-bde.ko
        # insmod linux-bcm-knet.ko

3) Install OpenNSL shared library. The destination directory to install the
   shared library depends on the host environment configuration.  Install the
   library files in a location included in the system's library search path.
   # mv libopennsl.so.1 /usr/lib
   # cd /usr/lib
   # ln -sf libopennsl.so.1 libopennsl.so

4) cd to the target deliverables directory and run the sample application.
    # chmod +x sample_application
    #./sample_application
